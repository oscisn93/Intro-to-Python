# Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. 
# Store at least three names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. 
# Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen. 
# Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error, 
# and print a friendly message if a file is missing. 
# Temporarily rename each of your files, 
# and make sure the code in the except block executes properly.  
# Make sure an exception is caught for either file missing.
