# Visit Project Gutenberg (https://gutenberg.org/Links to an external site.)
# and find a few texts youâ€™d like to analyze. 
# Download the text files for these works, 
# or copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your computer.
# Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg 
# and determines how many times the word 'the' appears in each text. 
# This count will be an approximation because of the way split() works.  
# To get a better idea of what split() is doing, print the list.  
# Include an appropriate exception handler for file not found.
# You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word appears in a list.
