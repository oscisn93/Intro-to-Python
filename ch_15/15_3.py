# 15-3. Molecular Motion: Modify rw_visual_7.py by replacing ax.scatter() with ax.plot(). To simulate the path of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of water, pass in the rw.x_values and rw.y_values, and include a linewidth argument of 1. Use 5000 instead of 50,000 points.  ax.plot() can be found in mpl_squares_x.py.
