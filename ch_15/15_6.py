# 15-6. Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two eight-sided dice 1000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will look like before you run the simulation; then see if your intuition was correct. Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your systemâ€™s capabilities.  Adjust comments, labels and file names for the new program.   Start with die_visual_4.py.
