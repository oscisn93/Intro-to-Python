# 15-4. Modified Random Walks: Start with the program from 15-3.  
# Create a copy of the RandomWalk class called RandomWalk1 still within the file random_walk.py.  
# In the RandomWalk1 class, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. 
# The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 
# Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. 
# Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the â€“1 from the x or y direction list.  
# Turn in the most unusual result you find.
